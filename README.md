Virtual eBay merchant. Pick up stuff from your friends and neighbors houses. Sell it, then give them 50% of the profits (I really want this).


## Project Structure

You will need to build a landing page with your business product being showcased, and an email signup form. This email form should be signed up to something like Mailchimp(mailchimp.com). which will allow you to collect user emails to see how many people are interested in your product. You will now have a way to test your idea and see if people like it! Remember: the idea can be silly. You will be judged on the website, not on the product or how valid of an idea it is. Have fun with it.
